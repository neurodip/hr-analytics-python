## Key Insights from Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Higher attrition rates observed in the Sales department and among low-income employees  
ðŸ”¹ Female employees showed slightly higher attrition compared to males  
ðŸ”¹ Employees with poor Work-Life Balance are significantly more likely to resign  
ðŸ”¹ Low Job Satisfaction correlates directly with higher attrition  
ðŸ”¹ Employees in lower job levels and with fewer working years are at greater risk of leaving  
ðŸ”¹ Certain education fields and job roles show higher turnover trends

## Conclusion & Recommendations

- Focus on improving Work-Life Balance for high-risk employees  
- Review compensation for low-income groups to reduce turnover  
- Provide clear career growth paths for junior employees  
- Sales & specific Education Fields need targeted retention strategies
