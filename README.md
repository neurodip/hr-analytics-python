## Key Insights from Analysis

- Higher attrition rates observed in the Sales department and among low-income employees  
- Female employees showed slightly higher attrition compared to males  
- Employees with poor Work-Life Balance are significantly more likely to resign  
- Low Job Satisfaction correlates directly with higher attrition  
- Employees in lower job levels and with fewer working years are at greater risk of leaving  
- Certain education fields and job roles show higher turnover trends

- Review compensation for low-income groups to reduce turnover  
- Provide clear career growth paths for junior employees  
- Sales & specific Education Fields need targeted retention strategies
